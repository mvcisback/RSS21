\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented ERCI, a framework to control improvisation in stochastic games. Our results show that ERCI can be used to synthesize policies that besides meeting temporal logic specifications induce varying behavior, e.g., to test and certify the correctness of other robots. Future work includes applying the framework to a broader spectrum of applications and extending the theory to games with imperfect information.
