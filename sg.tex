MDP algorithm in hand, we are now ready to provide an algorithm for
stochastic games. At a high level, this algorithm works by initially
planning for $\pTwo$ selecting the action that minimizes randomness
(with ties broken by performance). If this assumption is ever
violated, the resulting state must support more randomness.
The $\pOne$ policy is thus adjusted to match the worst case
randomness, which due to monotonicity of $\solfuncp$, can only
increase performance. We formalize below.

 First and foremost, observe that in order to render an ERCI instance
un-achievable, it suffices for an adversarial $\pTwo$ to violate
either the performance threshold OR the randomness threshold.  Next,
notice that because $\pOneSched$ is a priori fixed, $\pTwoSched$ can
be seen as repeatedly selecting between a convex combination of
$\rndp$ (and $\scp$) for the corresponding sub-graph. As the maximum of a
convex combination is always achievable on the boundaries, we can
w.l.o.g. assume that $\pTwoSched$ is \emph{deterministic}.  Similarly,
notice that given a fixed $\pOneSched$, the worst-case $\pTwoSched$
response can be computed via dynamic programming in topological order
from the leafs to the root of $\sg$. We shall refer to this policy
as $\pTwoSchedWorstH$.

On the other hand, suppose $\pTwoSched$ was known, reducing the SG to
a MDP. As discussed in the previous section, for the MDP case, it
suffices to consider rationality indexed policies. Let use denote the
resulting MDP and  maximum causal entropy family of (partial) policies as
$\sg[\pTwoSched]$ and $\sched_\rat[\pTwoSched]$ resp.

As stated at the start of the section, our key insight is to initially
assume that $\pTwoSched = \pTwoSchedWorstH$. Then for each rationality
coefficient, we associate the causal entropy of the subgraph rooted
at that state....
