\paragraph{Contribution}

\begin{itemize}
\item We conservatively genalize control improvisation from the deterministic to the stochastic setting (MDPs) by adopting ideas from specification inference.
\item We further conservatively extend these ideas to support reactive control improvisation in stochastic games
\item We contrast control improvisation for stochastic games with policy sampling, i.e., with uniformly sampling schedulers satisfying given temporal constraints.
\item We provide a scalable prototypical implementation.
\end{itemize}
