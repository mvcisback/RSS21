\mypara{Setup} To experimentally validate the feasibility of our ERCI
algorithm for SGs, we implemented~\cite{RSS21code} our algorithm in
Python.  Inspired by the recent work on compressing
game graphs for specification
inference~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/Vazquez-Chanlatte20}, each SG was
represented as a Binary Decision Diagram
(BDD)~\cite{DBLP:journals/csur/Bryant92} using the \texttt{dd} and
\texttt{py-aiger} python packages~\cite{dd, pyAiger}.

We investigate the motivating example.
Specifically, our experiments used
a $k\times k$ grid discretization of the workspace (cf.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:motivating}), for $k \in
\{4,5,6,7\}$ where the four target houses lie in
$\{\lfloor\nicefrac{k}{3}\rfloor, \lfloor\nicefrac{2k}{3}\rfloor
\}^2$, and the drones $\droneEgo$ and $\droneEnv$ are initially at in the bottom left corner and top right house resp. Furthermore, for simplicity, we embedded the avoid crash
condition as part of the soft constraint, rather than a hard
constraint\footnotemark. We took~$\pOne$'s dynamics to be deterministic
and modeled $\pTwo$ as visiting each house in either clock-wise or
counter-wise order, where the orientation can switch with
(a potentially state dependent) probability $p \in [\nicefrac{1}{100},
\nicefrac{1}{50}]$ whenever a house is visited. Next, we considered an
alternation between $\pOne$ and $\pTwo$ to be a single logical time
step, and (non-uniformly) instantiate problem instances with horizons
ranging from $10$ to $35$, i.e., paths ranged from length $20$ to
$70$.
\footnotetext{Note that counter-intuitively, only using soft
constraints generally results in harder instances as the game graphs
are larger.}



%Finally, we implemented a prototype ERCI synthesis algorithm in Python.
%Inspired by the recent work on compressing game graphs for specification
%inference~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/Vazquez-Chanlatte20}, each SG was represented
%as a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD)~\cite{DBLP:journals/csur/Bryant92} using the
%dd and py-aiger python packages~\cite{dd, pyAiger}. As demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_times},
%this introduced negligible overhead, while dramatically decreasing the size
%of the game graph.\footnotemark 

\mypara{Results} First and foremost, we succeed in synthesizing
controllers in the mentioned setup.  The controller randomizes its
behavior while meeting the specification, which is not surprising as
the algorithm yields a correct-by-construction policy.

Next, we consider the practical run time of our algorithm.  As
Fig~\ref{fig:exp_times} demonstrates, the empirical time to estimate
the Pareto front seemed to increase linearly with our game graph
encoding -- which is consistent with our complexity analysis.
Moreover, our encoding seems to linearly track with the horizon for
all $k$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:bdd_sizes}), suggesting that the overall run
time grows linearly in the horizon within our parameterization. When
combined with the potential to parallelize across the rationality
coefficients, these results suggest that practical optimizations to
our ERCI algorithm may admit usage on other more complicated
benchmarks. Finally, we remark that the use of a decision diagram
encoding did indeed dramatically decrease the size of the game graph
(with negligible overhead).\footnotemark

\footnotetext{For example, the $(k=7,\text{horizon}=40)$ case is
encoded using a 505,100 node BDD ($|\sg| = 243,365$ nodes). Compare with
the direct encoding $|\sg| = |S|\cdot \tau \cdot |\text{monitor state}| = (7\times 7)^2 \cdot (2 \cdot 40) \cdot (2^4\cdot 2) \approx 6,000,000$.}
